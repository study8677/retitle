# 🏷️ retitle

### Your AI coding sessions, always named after what they're *actually* about.

Claude Code, Codex and Cursor name a chat from your **first message** — then never look back.
Two hours later the conversation is about something completely different, but the sidebar
still says *"Check if branches are synced."* Multiply that by fifty sessions and your history
is useless for finding anything.

**`retitle` runs quietly in the background and, whenever a session goes idle, rewrites its
title to match the latest work — across all three tools.** And `retitle search` lets you
find any past session across Claude Code, Codex and Cursor at once.

## The problem

Every AI coding tool auto-titles a session once, from its opening prompt, and freezes it there:

| Tool | What the sidebar says | What the session is now about |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Cursor** | `Add a loading spinner` | *migrating the database to Postgres* |
| **Codex** | `Fix a typo in the README` | *debugging a flaky CI pipeline* |
| **Claude Code** | `Check if branches are synced` | *implementing the audit-log feature* |

The title is a lie within ten minutes. `retitle` keeps it honest.

<sub>(Examples are illustrative — `retitle` reads your sessions locally and never publishes them anywhere.)</sub>

## What it looks like

```console
$ retitle list

Claude Code
     16m  Check if branches are synced          → Implement the audit-log feature
     34m  —                                     → Fix dashboard white-screen on load
      2m  Refactor the deploy script            · active

Codex
    1.2h  Set up the new service                → Design the session auto-rename flow
    2.1h  Review the API changes                · no new content since last rename

Cursor
     29m  Add a loading spinner                 → 修复登录页面的样式问题
    2.4h  First sync question                   → Track down the duplicate-error bug

7 session(s) would be renamed next pass (idle ≥ 5m, namer=heuristic).
Run `retitle once` to apply, or `retitle install` to do it continuously.
```

## 🔍 Also: find any past session

Accurate titles are only half the point — the other half is *finding* the session
again. `retitle search` looks across Claude Code, Codex and Cursor at once:

```console
$ retitle search "stripe webhook"

🔍 "stripe webhook" — 2 matches

  Cursor        3h    Wire up the Stripe webhook handler    payments-api
  Claude Code   2d    Debug the Stripe webhook signature    billing-svc

$ retitle search postgres --content      # also grep message text, with snippets
```

---

## Quick start

`retitle` is pure Python with **zero dependencies**. Install it as an isolated CLI:

```bash
# with pipx (recommended)
pipx install git+https://github.com/study8677/retitle.git

# or with uv
uv tool install git+https://github.com/study8677/retitle.git

# or from source
git clone https://github.com/study8677/retitle.git && cd retitle
pip install -e .
```

Then:

```bash
retitle status         # what did it detect on this machine?
retitle list           # preview: current title → proposed title (writes nothing)
retitle once           # do one rename pass right now
retitle install        # run it forever in the background (launchd / systemd)
```

That's it. With `retitle install` it wakes up every minute, finds sessions that have been idle
for 5 minutes, and retitles the ones whose content has changed since it last looked.

## How it works

```
        ┌──────────── every  poll_seconds (default 60s) ────────────┐
        │                                                           │
   discover ──► for each session idle ≥ 5m with NEW content ──► namer ──► write title back
   (per tool)         │                                           │            │
   Claude Code        │ skip if still active                      │            ├─ Claude Code: append an `ai-title` line
   Codex              │ skip if unchanged since last rename        │            ├─ Codex:       UPDATE threads SET title
   Cursor             │ skip if a human renamed it (until          │            └─ Cursor:      patch composerHeaders + composerData
                      │      the conversation moves on)            │
```

The decision rule for each session is deliberately conservative:

1. **Still in use?** Idle for less than your threshold → leave it alone.
2. **Nothing new?** Content hash matches the title we last wrote → skip (re-runs are free).
3. **Renamed by hand?** We never clobber a human edit — until you send new messages and it goes idle again.
4. Otherwise: generate a fresh title and write it.

This makes the whole thing **idempotent** and **safe to run continuously**.

## Supported tools

| Tool | Reads | Writes | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/**/<id>.jsonl` | appends an `ai-title` line (append-only — the safest write) | ✅ stable |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/state_*.sqlite` + rollout files | `UPDATE threads SET title` | ✅ stable |
| **Cursor** | `state.vscdb` (`composerHeaders` + `composerData`) | patches both title fields | ⚠️ experimental |

> **A note on writing while the app is open.** Codex and Cursor keep their data in live SQLite
> databases. `retitle` writes carefully (read-only reads, `busy_timeout` on writes), and only
> ever touches *idle* sessions. Still, Cursor in particular caches chats in memory, so a title
> you change on disk may be overwritten if you reopen that exact chat in a running Cursor. For
> the most reliable Cursor results, let `retitle` run while Cursor is closed. Claude Code's
> append-only format has no such caveat.

## Naming backends

By default `retitle` uses a **heuristic** namer: it derives the title from your most recent
substantive message. It's instant, offline, costs nothing, and needs no API key — but it's
literally just a cleaned-up snippet of what you typed.

For genuinely good titles, point it at a model. Set `namer` in your config (or `--namer`):

| `namer` | What it does | Setup |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `heuristic` | latest message, cleaned up | none (default) |
| `claude` | shells out to the `claude` CLI | uses your existing Claude Code login |
| `codex` | shells out to the `codex` CLI | uses your existing Codex login |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic API directly | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | OpenAI API directly | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

```bash
retitle once --namer claude     # try the smart namer on one pass
```

---

## Configuration

`retitle config` creates and prints `~/.config/retitle/config.toml`:

```toml
idle_seconds = 300          # rename after 5 minutes idle
poll_seconds = 60           # scan once a minute
tools = ["claude-code", "codex", "cursor"]
namer = "heuristic"         # heuristic | claude | codex | anthropic | openai
max_age_days = 7            # ignore sessions older than a week
min_user_messages = 1       # need at least this many real messages
dry_run = false

[anthropic]
model = "claude-haiku-4-5"

[openai]
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

Any field can be overridden per-invocation: `retitle run --idle 600 --namer anthropic --tool cursor`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `retitle list` | Preview every discovered session and its proposed title (writes nothing) |
| `retitle search <q>` | Find sessions across all tools by title (add `--content` to grep message text) |
| `retitle once` | Run a single rename pass and exit |
| `retitle run` | Run continuously in the foreground (add `--once`, `--dry-run`) |
| `retitle install` | Install + start the background service (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux) |
| `retitle uninstall` | Stop and remove the background service |
| `retitle status` | Show config, detected tools, and daemon status |
| `retitle config` | Create / print the config file |

## Privacy & safety

- **Everything stays on your machine.** With the default `heuristic` namer, nothing ever leaves
  your computer. Only the `anthropic`/`openai` namers send a short transcript excerpt to that API
  (and only if you opt in by setting a key); the `claude`/`codex` namers go through tools you've
  already authorized.
- **It only ever changes titles.** `retitle` reads transcripts and writes a single title field /
  appends a single line. It never edits, deletes, or reorders your conversations.
- **It's reversible and idempotent.** A bad title is just a title — send a message and it gets
  re-evaluated. Re-running does nothing unless content changed.

## FAQ

**Will it fight with the tool's own auto-naming?**
No. The tools title once and stop; `retitle` only acts after a session is idle, so they aren't
writing at the same time.

**Will it overwrite titles I set myself?**
No — not until you add new messages to that session. Manual titles are respected until the
conversation actually moves on.

**Does it cost API tokens?**
Only if you choose an LLM namer. The default heuristic is free and offline.

**Is it safe to run all the time?**
Yes — that's the design. See [How it works](#how-it-works). The one caveat is editing Cursor's DB
while Cursor is open (above).

## Contributing

Adding support for another tool is one file — implement four methods (`available`, `discover`,
`read_transcript`, `set_title`) in `src/retitle/adapters/`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/study8677/retitle.git && cd retitle
pip install -e ".[dev]"
